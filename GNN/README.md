# GraVi-T
This repository contains an open-source codebase for Graph-based long-term Video undersTanding (GraVi-T). It is designed to serve as a spatial-temporal graph learning framework for multiple video understanding tasks. In the current version, it supports training and evaluating one of the state-of-the-art models, [SPELL](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136950367.pdf), for the tasks of active speaker detection, action localization, and action segmentation.

In the near future, we will release more advanced graph-based approaches (e.g. [STHG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10608)) for other tasks, including video summarization and audio-visual diarization.

## Ego4D Challenges and ActivityNet
We want to note that our method has recently won many challenges, including the Ego4D challenges [@ECCV22](https://ego4d-data.org/workshops/eccv22/), [@CVPR23](https://ego4d-data.org/workshops/cvpr23/) and ActivityNet [@CVPR22](https://research.google.com/ava/challenge.html). We summarize ASD (active speaker detection) and AVD (audio-visual diarization) performance comparisons on the validation set of the Ego4D dataset:
|  ASD Model  |  ASD mAP(%)&#8593;  |  ASD mAP@0.5(%)&#8593;  | AVD DER(%)&#8595;  |
|:------------|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|:------------------:|
|  RegionCls  |   -                 |  24.6                   |  80.0              |
|  TalkNet    |   -                 |  50.6                   |  79.3              |
|  [SPELL](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136950367.pdf) (Ours)      |   71.3  |  60.7  |  66.6  |
|  [STHG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10608) (Ours)  |   **75.7**   |  **63.7**  |  **59.4**  |

:bulb:In this table, We report two metrics to evaluate ASD performance: mAP quantifies the ASD results by assuming that the face bound-box detections are the ground truth (i.e. assuming the perfect face detector), whereas mAP@0.5 quantifies the ASD results on the detected face bounding boxes (i.e. a face detection is considered positive only if the IoU between a detected face bounding box and the ground-truth exceeds 0.5). For AVD, we report DER (diarization error rate): a lower DER value indicates a better AVD performance. For more information, please refer to our technical reports for the challenge.

:bulb:We computed mAP@0.5 by using [Ego4D's official evaluation tool](https://github.com/EGO4D/audio-visual/tree/main/active-speaker-detection/active_speaker/active_speaker_evaluation)

## Requirements
Preliminary requirements:
- Python>=3.7
- CUDA 11.6

Run the following command if you have CUDA 11.6:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install PyYAML, pandas, and [PyG](https://www.pyg.org)>=2.0.3 with CUDA>=11.1

## Installation
After confirming the above requirements, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/IntelLabs/GraVi-T.git
cd GraVi-T
pip3 install -e .
```

## Getting Started (Active Speaker Detection)
### Annotations
1) Download the annotations of AVA-ActiveSpeaker from the official site:
```
DATA_DIR="data/annotations"

wget https://research.google.com/ava/download/ava_activespeaker_val_v1.0.tar.bz2 -P ${DATA_DIR}
tar -xf ${DATA_DIR}/ava_activespeaker_val_v1.0.tar.bz2 -C ${DATA_DIR}
```

2) Preprocess the annotations:
```
python data/annotations/merge_ava_activespeaker.py
```

### Features
Download `RESNET18-TSM-AUG.zip` from the Google Drive link from [SPELL](https://github.com/SRA2/SPELL#code-usage) and unzip under `data/features`.
> We use the features from the thirdparty repositories.

### Directory Structure
The data directories should look as follows:
```
|-- data
    |-- annotations
        |-- ava_activespeaker_val_v1.0.csv
    |-- features
        |-- RESNET18-TSM-AUG
            |-- train
            |-- val
```

### Experiments
We can perform the experiments on active speaker detection with the default configuration by following the three steps below.

#### Step 1: Graph Generation
Run the following command to generate spatial-temporal graphs from the features:
```
python data/generate_spatial-temporal_graphs.py --features RESNET18-TSM-AUG --ec_mode csi --time_span 90 --tau 0.9
```
The generated graphs will be saved under `data/graphs`. Each graph captures long temporal context information in a video, which spans about 90 seconds (specified by `--time_span`).

#### Step 2: Training
Next, run the training script by passing the default configuration file:
```
python tools/train_context_reasoning.py --cfg configs/active-speaker-detection/ava_active-speaker/SPELL_default.yaml
```
The results and logs will be saved under `results`.

#### Step 3: Evaluation
Now, we can evaluate the trained model's performance:
```
python tools/evaluate.py --exp_name SPELL_ASD_default --eval_type AVA_ASD
```
This will print the evaluation score.
